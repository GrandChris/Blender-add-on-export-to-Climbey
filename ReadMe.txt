Blender pluging to convert specific blender files to Climbey custom levels.

Install io_export_Climbey.py as a add-on to blender. For a example level open Base_custom_level.blend in blender and file -> export -> Climbey (.txt) and save as "...Steam\SteamApps\common\Climbey\CustomLevels\Base_custom_level\Base_custom_level.txt".  For Climbey to recognize the file custom levels must be saved in "...Steam\SteamApps\common\Climbey\CustomLevels" in a folder with the same name as the levelfile (i.e. "...Steam\SteamApps\common\Climbey\CustomLevels\<fileName>\<fileName>.txt". If Climbey can't or only partially loads a file, then the export had a error or the folder containing the file is named incorrectly.

In Base_custom_level.blend, level settings are set by the custom object properties of the purple sign. Sign text is set by the "text" custom object property of the brown sign. The color of a object with the "light" material is determined by the RGB of it's blender material color. Edit made to the mesh's of the objects will not be reflected in the exported Climbey level. Objects in groups are not included in the export and must be made real (ctrl+shift+a be deafault) before exporting.
